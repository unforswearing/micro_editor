There are also a handful of in-development plugins that mostly started in `init.lua`. All of the following are in varying states of functionality and are best avoided.
- email

- scratchbuffer
- shellcheck
- switchtheme

All other plugins were installed via `plugin install` command in Micro. Please see the individual plugin folders for ownership and licensing information.
